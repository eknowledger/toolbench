### Patch Changes

- [#26](https://github.com/eknowledger/toolbench/pull/26) [`aeb5c50`](https://github.com/eknowledger/toolbench/commit/aeb5c5011948798210d5f059aa66e7a9364aff40) Thanks [@eknowledger](https://github.com/eknowledger)! - Published source maps now contain their sources. Previously the maps referenced `../src/*.ts`, which `files: ["dist"]` never shipped, so anyone stepping into either package in a debugger got a map pointing at nothing. Sources are embedded with `inlineSources`, so the maps are self-contained.
