## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/eknowledger/toolbench/pull/51) [`65dd2b0`](https://github.com/eknowledger/toolbench/commit/65dd2b0fcdcfdcd81651e48a73441e669e4eafcd) Thanks [@eknowledger](https://github.com/eknowledger)! - A card can show every primary input, and more than one result part

  Three changes, all of them about a card that had to say too little.

  **Every `primary` input, not the first.** The runtime used `find` where it meant `filter`, so a manifest
  marking two inputs primary got one and nothing said why. A question that needs two numbers cannot be asked
  with one: a queue card offering an arrival rate without a service time sizes nothing. `validate.ts` no
  longer caps the count either, which is a loosening rather than a change, so every manifest that validated
  before still validates and no tool has to change.

  **A new `parts` attribute on `<tool-host>`.** A compact card rendered exactly one part of a grouped result.
  One is too few for a tool whose answer is a number _and_ a curve, where the number alone hides how steep
  the curve is and the curve alone is a set of unnamed lines. `parts="2"` gives the card room for both, and
  whatever does not fit is still counted rather than hidden. Default 1, so existing cards render exactly as
  before.

  An attribute rather than a manifest key, deliberately: how much room a card has is a property of the page
  it sits on, not of the tool, and the same tool is a one-part card in a sidebar and a two-part card leading
  a section.

  **A card's chart is drawn smaller, not shorter.** Compact mode halved the chart's viewBox height, which took
  the plot area from 238 units to 88 and compressed a curve falling from 74% to nothing into an unreadable
  band, and dropped the axis titles, the annotation label and the legend with it. None of that was needed: the
  geometry is a viewBox scaled to the available width, so a chart on a narrow card is already smaller than one
  on a page with its aspect ratio intact. The chart is now identical everywhere, and compact changes only the
  rendered size, capped at `--tb-chart-card-max` (52rem). Labels stay legible below that width via a container
  query, since text inside a viewBox otherwise shrinks with it.

  **A result summary is announced, not displayed.** "6 fields, chart, 2 series, table, 5 rows" rendered above
  the result as a line that reads like debug output, describing something already on screen. It is what a
  screen reader needs and what a sighted reader does not, so it moves to a visually hidden live region. The
  visible line keeps what a reader can act on: prompts, a sample's name, and errors.

  No contract version change. Nothing here adds or alters a manifest key, and the one rule that changed was
  removed rather than added.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#46](https://github.com/eknowledger/toolbench/pull/46) [`dc13784`](https://github.com/eknowledger/toolbench/commit/dc13784af5759a5c651f98d06ba142c36f2889a2) Thanks [@eknowledger](https://github.com/eknowledger)! - Contract version 3 adds the optional `samples` manifest key: labelled example inputs a tool ships with, so a reader who does not know what to type has somewhere to start.

  ```jsonc
  "samples": [
    { "label": "Definitions disagree", "input": { "values": "3 4 4 5 6 7 9 14 40 260", "method": "linear" } },
    { "label": "Not a number", "input": { "values": "12, 14, 15, 18ms, 21, 24, 31, 44" } }
  ]
  ```

  The runtime draws them as a row of buttons under the form, in `page` and `embed` mode. Clicking one fills the form, which is an input change like any other: the result goes stale and waits for Run, or re-runs if the tool set `autoRun`. Each `input` is keyed by input id and may be partial, so a sample changes the one thing it is about and leaves the rest as the reader left it. A card draws no row, because it has room for one input and a Run button.

  `validateManifest` checks every sample against the inputs it fills: an unknown input id, a value of the wrong type, a number outside `min`/`max`, a string over `maxLength`, a `select` value that is not an option, a sample that fills nothing, an empty `samples` array and two samples sharing a label are all refused, naming the field. `checkToolDirectory` additionally runs every declared sample, so an example that crashes the tool fails the build with its label in the message; an `error` result is a pass, since a malformed example is one of the most useful a tool can ship.

  Existing tools are unaffected and need no change. Both halves of the `2 → 3` migration are the identity function, and no existing tool's fixtures were edited, which is what makes this a minor bump rather than a major one.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#30](https://github.com/eknowledger/toolbench/pull/30) [`d5135ad`](https://github.com/eknowledger/toolbench/commit/d5135ad8ca2c96f41d16a46f99b6a1c23b3bee3a) Thanks [@eknowledger](https://github.com/eknowledger)! - Contract version 2 adds the `bytes` output kind, for wire formats and hex dumps: offsets, hex, a printable gutter, and named highlight ranges that can start mid-row and wrap. A `table` could approximate this but gets alignment and spanning wrong, and has nowhere to put a range that crosses rows.

  Tools declaring `"sdk": 1` are unaffected and need no change. Raising the contract version is a minor bump, never a major one, because contract changes are additive by policy.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#26](https://github.com/eknowledger/toolbench/pull/26) [`aeb5c50`](https://github.com/eknowledger/toolbench/commit/aeb5c5011948798210d5f059aa66e7a9364aff40) Thanks [@eknowledger](https://github.com/eknowledger)! - Published source maps now contain their sources. Previously the maps referenced `../src/*.ts`, which `files: ["dist"]` never shipped, so anyone stepping into either package in a debugger got a map pointing at nothing. Sources are embedded with `inlineSources`, so the maps are self-contained.
